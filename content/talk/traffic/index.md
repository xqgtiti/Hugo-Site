summary: "

* Collected multi-sources urban traffic data of San Francisco and New York City and performed data processing and analysis.

* Proposed an urban critical incident discover method and designed a binary classifier to extract the latent impact features of traffic incidents for improving speed prediction. Achieved a 0.82 test F1-score of SFO and a 0.80 test F1-score of NYC.

* Proposed a Deep Graph Convolutional Network to effectively incorporate incident, spatio-temporal, periodic and context features for traffic speed prediction. Achieved a 0.82 test F1-score of SFO and a 0.80 test F1-score of NYC. Achieved a 11.02% Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of SFO and 17.21% MAPE of NYC.
