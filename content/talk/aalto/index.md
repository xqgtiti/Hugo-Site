summary: "

* Built a Visual Geometry Group(VGG) based deep learning model for predicting the renovation progress of kitchen images (multiple classification). Achieved a 0.435 test Top1-accuracy and a 0.85 test Top2 accuracy on kitchen dataset. 

* Built a VGG based deep learning model to evaluate the quality of renovation (binary classification). Achieved a test 0.91 accuracy on kitchen dataset.

* Implemented an occlusion sensitivity method to detect the key areas in images that affect the prediction results.
