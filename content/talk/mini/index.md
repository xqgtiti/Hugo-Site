summary: "

* Implemented a WeChat mini-program with identical functionality as an existing Android app to understand sources of app size discrepancy. Performed a empirical analysis of 200 mini-programs and their Android counterparts.

* Crawled and decompiled 3200 Android apps. Performed detailed analysis and confirmed linked libraries as a dominant factor in apps's overall size.

* Developed an app trimming framework to automatically trim existing Android apps. For 40% of the test apps, the framework can reduce the app size by at least 10MB.
