summary: "

* Proposed a black-box system design of adversarial attack on graph data of real scenes (node classification task).

* Built an attack model based on Graph Convolutional Network model and implemented a similarity-based attack method. Implemented large-scale training (node sampling) on large-scale graph, e.g., Reddit dataset.
